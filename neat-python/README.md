## NOTES ##

Some large-scale changes are in progress on the [refactor-and-simplify branch](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python/tree/refactor-and-simplify). 
Once these are more stable they will be released as version 0.9.


The more complicated examples have been moved into a [separate repository](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python-examples) 
(and eventually a separate Python package on PyPI) from the NEAT library 
itself.  

## About ##

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural 
networks. This project is a Python implementation of NEAT.  It was forked from the excellent project by @MattKallada, 
and is in the process of being updated to provide more features and a (hopefully) simpler and documented API.

For further information regarding general concepts and theory, please see [Selected Publications](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publications) on Stanley's website.


## Getting Started ##

If you want to try neat-python, please check out the repository, start playing with the examples (`examples/xor` is a good place to start) and then try creating your own experiment.

The documentation, which is still a work in progress, is available on [Read The Docs](http://neat-python.readthedocs.io).
